# seizure_detection_RNN
The code was generated by copilot based on series question and feedback to copilot with log from the code.
Dataset can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adibadea/chbmitseizuredataset
Keep the traning dataset and individual samples in folder called dataset/
There are three files
train.py = make the model RNN with CNN for training dataset
ind_dataset_make.py = from the traing dataset, create individual test samples 
predict.py = predict the individual test samples based model generated by train.py
